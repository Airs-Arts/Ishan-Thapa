My journey towards becoming a data analyst has been an adventure fueled by a deep-seated passion for uncovering the intricate narratives concealed within datasets. Graduating with a Bachelor of Business Information Systems from the Australian Institute of Higher Education, I embarked on this path armed with a thirst for knowledge and a desire to make sense of the world through data.

As I delved deeper into the realm of data analysis, I honed my skills across various domains. From mastering the intricacies of Power BI to delving into the complexities of star schemas and fact tables, each skill became a stepping stone in my quest for understanding. Joins, CTEs, and triggers soon became familiar companions, guiding me through the labyrinth of databases and empowering me to extract meaningful insights.
